# 360-degree object detection and assistance for visually impaired people 
AI-based object detection for visually impaired users, employing ResNet18 and NLP for intuitive navigation. This repository contains the source code for an application designed to aid visually impaired people by utilizing a 360Â° view camera on a mobile phone. The application provides voice-assisted navigation to detect and locate objects within the environment, enhancing mobility and independence for users with visual impairments.

## Features

  * **Object Detection:** Utilizes ResNet18 to detect and classify objects in real-time.
  * **Distance Calculation:** Employs OpenCV and Triangle Similarity Laws to calculate and report the distance of detected objects from the user.
  * **Direction Indication:** Provides the user with the relative direction of the detected object (e.g., left, right, front, back).
  * **Audio Feedback:** Offers vocal announcements about object details, which can be delivered in English, Hindi, or Marathi.
  * **Assistive Navigation:** Includes an assistive robot prototype that guides the user to the object's location using IR sensors and audio signals.
